# WebGL
Task, Homeworks and resources for the WebGL course at my university.

Most of the code in this repository works but is not optimal since this is my first time learning computer graphics. I also think the library we created for the course should be reworked because currently it makes use of global variables and there are some bad coding practices included. Also I did not document my solutions very well. I should work on this but I did not have the time. They definetely work but I would suggest reading through the presentations before trying to understande them. Some formulas were just me playing with numbers untill I got it to look right. The course includes 11 homeworks and a ton of tasks. The tasks I will try to do in time but currently I have managed to reach only Lecture 5. The course is really good if you are studying Computer Science at Sofia university I highly suggest you take a look at it.
